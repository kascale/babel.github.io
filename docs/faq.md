## Help?! I just want to use Babel like it was in 5.x! Everything is too complicated now!

We hear you! Babel 6 requires a tiny bit of configuration in order to get going.
[We think this is for the best](/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0/) and have added
[presets](/docs/plugins#presets) to ease this transition.

## Upgrading from Babel 5.x to Babel 6

At the heart of Babel 6 are [plugins](/docs/plugins). What plugins you need completely
depends on your specific configuration but just add the following `.babelrc` file to
get all the same transforms that were in Babel 5:

```json
// .babelrc
{
  "presets": ["es2015", "react", "stage-2"]
}
```

```sh
$ npm install babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-2 --save-dev
```

Also check out our [Setting up Babel 6](http://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/31/setting-up-babel-6) blog post.

## Where did all the docs go?!

Babel 6 removes a lot of the options in favor of <a href="/docs/plugins">plugins</a> so a
lot of the docs are no longer applicable.

For every removed option there should be a plugin for it. It's possible we may have missed
something, if you think this is the case, please
<a href="https://phabricator.babeljs.io/maniphest/task/create/">open an issue</a>!

Babel is an open source project and we appreciate any and all contributions we can get.
Please help out with documentation if you can by submitting a pull request to the
[babel.github.io](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io) repo.

## Why is babel-x's dependency on `babel-runtime` not updated?

Babel 6 (all the packages themselves) use babel 5 to compile plugins.

As an example, `babel-generator@6.x.x` itself is written in ES6 and transpiled with babel 5.x so it uses `babel-runtime@5.x` for it's own code and not related to the a user's output code.

## Why isn't a certain babel-x package updated?

When we do a release, the only packages that get updated are the packages that
actually had changes (we do a `git diff` on that folder).

If we only update `babel-plugin-transform-exponentiation-operator` to 6.x.x, currently we don't publish a new version for all packages since the other dependencies are using `^`.

> We are looking into determining all cross-dependencies and automatically modifying the dependencies and using either strict versions or `~`.

For example, the Babel [v6.6.0 release](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v6.6.0) doesn't mean all packages are now 6.6.0.

To make sure you are using the latest package versions, you may need to remove `node_modules` and `npm install` again.
